Hello?
What is wrong Bob?
Well what do you remember?
Can you describe the lights?
Do you see anything else?
A lot? Like how much a lot?
Why don't you go closer for a better look?
What do you see now?
How so?
What does it say?
Can you give me an example?
Ohh I see. Why don't you tell me about the lights.
Is there a pattern to them?
Well why don't you read some lights to me.
