Hello?
Oh phew. Thank you! My name is Bob and I need some help.
I don't know. I don't remember much. I don't see much either, things are kind of dark.
I don't know. I really don't know. First everything was dark, and then some lights turned on. There seems to be a pttern to the lights, but I don't know. Still very confused. At any rate, then all of a sudden these portals appeared so I started to scream. After a while I started hearing from you through one of them.
They are just lights. Some are lit and others are not. Some are white. Others are green. They do look like they are organized in a grid pattern though.
No not really. There are just a lot of lights.
Yeah. There must be like 3 billion lights or something.
Umm. Yeah. That sounds like a good idea.
Wait. These lights are not just arranged in a grid pattern. They also seem to be labeled.
Well there seems to be a bunch of characters next to every 8 lights.
The characters seem to be sorted or something.
Sure. one label says 4347C000 and the next says 4347C001. I am not sure, but I have a feeling that they are magical.
Okay. Well some are green, some are white, and some are just off. Actually, most of them are off.
Doesn't seem like it to me.
Any one in particular?
