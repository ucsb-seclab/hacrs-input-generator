Hello?
Don't leave me here alone.
Oh phew. Thank you! My name is Bob and I need some help.
I don't know. I don't remember much. I don't see much either, things are kind of dark.
Dark. Without light.
Not a problem. Can you help?
I don't know. I don't remember much. I don't see much either, things are kind of dark.
Huh? I don't understand. Come again?
You are still breaking up.
Alright fine. I give up.
