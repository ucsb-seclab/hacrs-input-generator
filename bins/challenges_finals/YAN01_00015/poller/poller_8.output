Hello?
Oh phew. Thank you! My name is Bob and I need some help.
I don't know. I don't remember much. I don't see much either, things are kind of dark.
Dark. Without light.
Not a problem. Can you help?
I don't know. I don't remember much. I don't see much either, things are kind of dark.
I don't know. I really don't know. First everything was dark, and then some lights turned on. There seems to be a pttern to the lights, but I don't know. Still very confused. At any rate, then all of a sudden these portals appeared so I started to scream. After a while I started hearing from you through one of them.
I don't know. I just call it a portal. Use your imagination
Maybe I should just give up now. It's a HOLE!. A HOLE okay? That's your portal.
Don't get snarky on me. I didn't say HOLE because its not A HOLE. It is a portal. It is a hole with shiny lights and stuff.
AHH! I can't take this anymore.
