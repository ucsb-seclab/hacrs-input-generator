Hello?
Don't leave me here alone.
*brrring* *brrring* Hey, do you hear that? It's your phone. You should pick it up.
Oh phew. Thank you! My name is Bob and I need some help.
How do you know about Alice?
What? They are supposed to be encrypted. How did you do that?
Huh? What are you talking about? I never wrote my keys down.
Analyst? What kind of analyst?
Programs? Like television programs?
So what does that have to do with me?
You're weird.
