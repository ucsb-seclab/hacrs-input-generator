Hello?
Oh phew. Thank you! My name is Bob and I need some help.
I don't know. I don't remember much. I don't see much either, things are kind of dark.
I don't know. I really don't know. First everything was dark, and then some lights turned on. There seems to be a pttern to the lights, but I don't know. Still very confused. At any rate, then all of a sudden these portals appeared so I started to scream. After a while I started hearing from you through one of them.
Interesting? You mean frightening!
IT IS NOT INTERESTING!!!
Huh? I don't understand. Come again?
You are still breaking up.
Alright fine. I give up.
