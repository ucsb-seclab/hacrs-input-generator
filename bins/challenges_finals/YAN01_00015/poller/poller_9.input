Hello?
Is there something wrong with Alice?
I read your communications.
Sure they were encrypted. But you left your keys lying around.
That is true, but I can see into your head. Or at least what will become your head.
I analyze and reverse engineer programs.
No computer programs.
Nothing. Just nothing.
