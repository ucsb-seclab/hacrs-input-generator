For what material would you like to run this simulation?
  1. Air
  2. Aluminum
  3. Copper
  4. Custom
Selection: Enter the thermal conductivities in W/(m*K) for your material at the following temperatures (Celcius):
-264.15: -193.15: -112.15:  -31.15:   49.85:  129.85:  210.85:  291.85: Enter the heat capacity in J/(m^3*K) for your material when it is at the following temperatures (Celcius):
-264.15: -193.15: -112.15:  -31.15:   49.85:  129.85:  210.85:  291.85: How large is the material (X,Y,Z meters): Should the material be isothermic? (y,n):   Send the grid temperatures as a comma separated list of Celcius decimal values.
  The program will populate the X, then Y, then Z dimensions of the room.
Are there any constant energy sources in the room? (y,n): For how lold you like to run the simulation? (s): [2J[Hz: 0
