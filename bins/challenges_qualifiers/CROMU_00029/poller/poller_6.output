  4. Custom
Selection: How large is the material (X,Y,Z meters): Should the material be isothermic? (y,n):   Send the grid temperatures as a comma separated list of Celcius decimal values.
  The program will populate the X, then Y, then Z dimensions of the room.
Are there any constant energy sources in the room? (y,n): For how long would you like to run the simulation? (s): [2J[Hz: 0
