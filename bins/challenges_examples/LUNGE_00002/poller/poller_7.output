3.802 Statutory prohibition and requirement.
(a) 31 U.S.C. 1352 prohibits a recipient of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from using appropriated funds to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any covered Federal actions.
(1) For purposes of this subpart the term  appropriated funds  does not include profit or fee from a covered Federal action.
(2) To the extent a person can demonstrate that the person has sufficient monies, other than Federal appropriated funds, the Government shall assume that these other monies were spent for any influencing activities that would be unallowable if paid for with Federal appropriated funds.
(b) 31 U.S.C. 1352 also requires offerors to furnish a declaration consisting of both a certification and a disclosure, with periodic updates of the disclosure after contract award. These requirements are contained in the provision at 52.203-11 , Certification and Disclosure Regarding Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, and the clause at 52.203-12 , Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions.
3.803 Exceptions.
(a) The prohibition of paragraph 3.802 (a) does not apply under the following conditions:
(1) Agency and legislative liaison by own employees .
(i) Payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action. For purposes of this paragraph, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is permitted at any time.
(ii) Participating with an agency in discussions that are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action, but that concern  
(A) The qualities and characteristics (including individual demonstrations) of the person  s products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; or
(B) The application or adaptation of the person  s products or services for an agency  s use.
(iii) Providing prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action.
(iv) Participating in technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission.
(v) Making capability presentations prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action when seeking an award from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Pub. L. 95-507, and subsequent amendments.
(2) Professional and technical services.
(i) Payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal action;
(ii) Any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action, or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal action. Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.
(iii) As used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  professional and technical services  are limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional or a technical person are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client  s proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another, are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
(iv) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(b) Only those communications and services expressly authorized by paragraph (a) of this section are permitted.
(c) The disclosure requirements of paragraph 3.802 (b) do not apply with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.
3.804 Policy.
The contracting officer shall obtain certifications and disclosures as required by the provision at 52.203-11 , Certification and Disclosure Regarding Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, prior to the award of any contract exceeding $150,000.
3.805 Exemption.
The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibitions of this subpart whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of the exemption to Congress immediately after making the determination.
3.806 Processing suspected violations.
The contracting officer shall report suspected violations of the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 1352 in accordance with agency procedures.
3.807 Civil penalties.
Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804-3808, and 3812, insofar as the provisions therein are not inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.
3.808 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
(a) Insert the provision at 52.203-11 , Certification and Disclosure Regarding Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, in solicitations expected to exceed $150,000.
(b) Insert the clause at 52.203-12 , Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions, in solicitations and contracts expected to exceed $150,000.

19.701 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)  means any Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, Urban Corporation, or Group Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended ( 43 U.S.C. 1601 , et seq .) and which is considered a minority and economically disadvantaged concern under the criteria at 43 U.S.C. 1626(e)(1) . This definition also includes ANC direct and indirect subsidiary corporations, joint ventures, and partnerships that meet the requirements of 43 U.S.C. 1626(e)(2) .
Commercial plan  means a subcontracting plan (including goals) that covers the offeror  s fiscal year and that applies to the entire production of commercial items sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof ( e.g., division, plant, or product line).
Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS)  means the Governmentwide, electronic, web-based system for small business subcontracting program reporting.
Failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting plan  means willful or intentional failure to perform in accordance with the requirements of the subcontracting plan, or willful or intentional action to frustrate the plan.
Indian tribe  means any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community, including native villages and native groups (including corporations organized by Kenai, Juneau, Sitka, and Kodiak) as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act ( 43 U.S.C.A. 1601 et seq .), that is recognized by the Federal Government as eligible for services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 1452(c) . This definition also includes Indian-owned economic enterprises that meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 1452(e) .
Individual contract plan  means a subcontracting plan that covers the entire contract period (including option periods), applies to a specific contract, and has goals that are based on the offeror  s planned subcontracting in support of the specific contract, except that indirect costs incurred for common or joint purposes may be allocated on a prorated basis to the contract.
Master plan  means a subcontracting plan that contains all the required elements of an individual contract plan, except goals, and may be incorporated into individual contract plans, provided the master plan has been approved.
Subcontract  means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies and/or services required for performance of the contract, contract modification, or subcontract.
19.702 Statutory requirements.
Any contractor receiving a contract for more than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns will have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with its efficient performance. It is further the policy of the United States that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their subcontracts with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.
(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637(d) ) imposes the following requirements regarding subcontracting with small businesses and small business subcontracting plans:
(1) In negotiated acquisitions, each solicitation of offers to perform a contract or contract modification, that individually is expected to exceed $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting possibilities, shall require the apparently successful offeror to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan. If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award.
(2) In sealed bidding acquisitions, each invitation for bids to perform a contract or contract modification, that individually is expected to exceed $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting possibilities, shall require the bidder selected for award to submit a subcontracting plan. If the selected bidder fails to submit a plan within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the bidder will be ineligible for award.
(b) Subcontracting plans (see paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section) are not required  
(1) From small business concerns;
(2) For personal services contracts;
(3) For contracts or contract modifications that will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas; or
(4) For modifications to contracts within the general scope of the contract that do not contain the clause at 52.219-8 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns (or equivalent prior clauses; e.g., contracts awarded before the enactment of Public Law 95-507).
(c) As stated in 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(8) , any contractor or subcontractor failing to comply in good faith with the requirements of the subcontracting plan is in material breach of its contract. Further, 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) directs that a contractor  s failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages.
(d) As authorized by 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(11) , certain costs incurred by a mentor firm in providing developmental assistance to a prot g  firm under the Department of Defense Pilot Mentor-Prot g  Program, may be credited as if they were subcontract awards to a prot g  firm for the purpose of determining whether the mentor firm attains the applicable goals under any subcontracting plan entered into with any executive agency. However, the mentor-prot g  agreement must have been approved by the Director, Small Business Programs of the cognizant DoD military department or defense agency, before developmental assistance costs may be credited against subcontract goals. A list of approved agreements may be obtained at http://www.acq.osd.mil/osbp/mentor_protege/ .
19.703 Eligibility requirements for participating in the program.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section to be eligible as a subcontractor under the program, a concern must represent itself as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or woman-owned small business concern.
(1) To represent itself as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or woman-owned small business concern, a concern must meet the appropriate definition (see 2.101 and 19.001 ).
(2) In connection with a subcontract, or a requirement for which the apparently successful offeror received an evaluation credit for proposing one or more SDB subcontractors, the contracting officer or the SBA may protest the disadvantaged status of a proposed subcontractor. Such protests will be processed in accordance with 13 CFR 124.1007 through 124.1014. Other interested parties may submit information to the contracting officer or the SBA in an effort to persuade the contracting officer or the SBA to initiate a protest. Such protests, in order to be considered timely, must be submitted to the SBA prior to completion of performance by the intended subcontractor.
(b) A contractor acting in good faith may rely on the written representation of its subcontractor regarding the subcontractor  s status as a small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or a woman-owned small business concern. The contractor, the contracting officer, or any other interested party can challenge a subcontractor  s size status representation by filing a protest, in accordance with 13 CFR 121.1001 through 121.1008. Protests challenging a subcontractor  s small disadvantaged business representation must be filed in accordance with 13 CFR 124.1007 through 124.1014.
(c)(1) In accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1626 , the following procedures apply:
(i) Subcontracts awarded to an ANC or Indian tribe shall be counted towards the subcontracting goals for small business and small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, regardless of the size or Small Business Administration certification status of the ANC or Indian tribe.
(ii) Where one or more subcontractors are in the subcontract tier between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate the appropriate contractor(s) to count the subcontract towards its small business and small disadvantaged business subcontracting goals.
(A) In most cases, the appropriate contractor is the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe.
(B) If the ANC or Indian tribe designates more than one contractor to count the subcontract toward its goals, the ANC or Indian tribe shall designate only a portion of the total subcontract award to each contractor. The sum of the amounts designated to various contractors cannot exceed the total value of the subcontract.
(C) The ANC or Indian tribe shall give a copy of the written designation to the contracting officer, the prime contractor, and the subcontractors in between the prime contractor and the ANC or Indian tribe within 30 days of the date of the subcontract award.
(D) If the contracting officer does not receive a copy of the ANC's or the Indian tribe  s written designation within 30 days of the subcontract award, the contractor that awarded the subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe will be considered the designated contractor.
(2) A contractor acting in good faith may rely on the written representation of an ANC or an Indian tribe as to the status of the ANC or Indian tribe unless an interested party challenges its status or the contracting officer has independent reason to question its status. In the event of a challenge of a representation of an ANC or Indian tribe, the interested parties shall follow the procedures at 26.103 (b) through (e).
(d)(1) The contractor shall confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is certified by SBA as a HUBZone small business concern by accessing the System for Award Management database or by contacting the SBA. Options for contacting the SBA include  
(i) HUBZone small business database search application web page at http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/dsp_searchhubzone.cfm or www.sba.gov/hubzone ;
(ii) In writing to the  
Director/HUB, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington DC 20416; or
(iii) E-mail at hubzone@sba.gov .
(2) Protests challenging HUBZone small business concern size status must be filed in accordance with 13 CFR 121.411.
19.704 Subcontracting plan requirements.

(7) The name of an individual employed by the offeror who will administer the offeror  s subcontracting program, and a description of the duties of the individual;
(8) A description of the efforts the offeror will make to ensure that small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts;
(9) Assurances that the offeror will include the clause at 52.219-8 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns (see 19.708 (a)), in all subcontracts that offer further subcon- tracting opportunities, and that the offeror will require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) that receive subcontracts in excess of $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) to adopt a plan that complies with the requirements of the clause at 52.219-9 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan (see 19.708 (b));
(10) Assurances that the offeror will  
(i) Cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required;
(ii) Submit periodic reports so that the Government can determine the extent of compliance by the offeror with the subcontracting plan;
(iii) Submit the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR), and the Summary Subcontract Report (SSR) using the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) ( http://www.esrs.gov ), following the instructions in the eSRS;
(A) The ISR shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period.
(B) The SSR shall be submitted as follows: For DoD and NASA, the report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30. For civilian agencies, except NASA, it shall be submitted annually for the twelve-month period ending September 30. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period.
(iv) Ensure that its subcontractors with subcontracting plans agree to submit the ISR and/or the SSR using the eSRS;
(v) Provide its prime contract number, its DUNS number, and the e-mail address of the offeror  s official responsible for acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISRs to all first-tier subcontractors with subcontracting plans so they can enter this information into the eSRS when submitting their ISRs; and
(vi) Require that each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan provide the prime contract number, its own DUNS number, and the e-mail address of the subcontractor  s official responsible for acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISRs, to its subcontractors with subcontracting plans.
(11) A description of the types of records that will be maintained concerning procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the plan, including establishing source lists; and a description of the offeror  s efforts to locate small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns and to award subcontracts to them.
(b) Contractors may establish, on a plant or division-wide basis, a master plan (see 19.701 ) that contains all the elements required by the clause at 52.219-9 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, except goals. Master plans shall be effective for a 3-year period after approval by the contracting officer; however, it is incumbent upon contractors to maintain and update master plans. Changes required to update master plans are not effective until approved by the contracting officer. A master plan, when incorporated in an individual plan, shall apply to that contract throughout the life of the contract.
(c) For multiyear contracts or contracts containing options, the cumulative value of the basic contract and all options is considered in determining whether a subcontracting plan is necessary (see 19.705-2 (a)). If a plan is necessary and the offeror is submitting an individual contract plan, the plan shall contain all the elements required by paragraph (a) of this section and shall contain separate statements and goals for the basic contract and for each option.
(d) A commercial plan (as defined in 19.701 ) is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. Once a contractor  s commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item. The contractor shall  
(1) Submit the commercial plan to either the first contracting officer awarding a contract subject to the plan during the contractor  s fiscal year, or, if the contractor has ongoing contracts with commercial plans, to the contracting officer responsible for the contract with the latest completion date. The contracting officer shall negotiate the commercial plan for the Government. The approved commercial plan shall remain in effect during the contractor  s fiscal year for all Government contracts in effect during that period; 
(2) Submit a new commercial plan, 30 working days before the end of the Contractor  s fiscal year, to the contracting officer responsible for the uncompleted Government contract with the latest completion date. The contractor must provide to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract subject to the plan, the identity of the contracting officer that will be negotiating the new plan;
(3) When the new commercial plan is approved, provide a copy of the approved plan to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract that is subject to the plan; and
(4) Comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (a)(10) of this section by submitting one SSR in eSRS, for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report will be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the contracting officer who approved the plan. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government  s fiscal year.
19.705 Responsibilities of the contracting officer under the subcontracting assistance program.
19.705-1 General support of the program.
The contracting officer may encourage the development of increased subcontracting opportunities in negotiated acquisition by providing monetary incentives such as payments based on actual subcontracting achievement or award-fee contracting (see the clause at 52.219-10 , Incentive Subcontracting Program, and 19.708 (c)). This subsection does not apply to SDB subcontracting (see 19.1203 ). When using any contractual incentive provision based upon rewarding the contractor monetarily for exceeding goals in the subcontracting plan, the contracting officer must ensure that (a) the goals are realistic and (b) any rewards for exceeding the goals are commensurate with the efforts the contractor would not have otherwise expended. Incentive provisions should normally be negotiated after reaching final agreement with the contractor on the subcontracting plan.
19.705-2 Determining the need for a subcontracting plan.
The contracting officer must take the following actions to determine whether a proposed contractual action requires a subcontracting plan:
(a) Determine whether the proposed contractual action will meet the dollar threshold in 19.702 (a)(1) or (2). If the action includes options or similar provisions, include their value in determining whether the threshold is met.
(b) Determine whether subcontracting possibilities exist by considering relevant factors such as  
(1) Whether firms engaged in the business of furnishing the types of items to be acquired customarily contract for performance of part of the work or maintain sufficient in-house capability to perform the work; and
(2) Whether there are likely to be product prequalification requirements.
(c) If it is determined that there are no subcontracting possibilities, the determination must be approved at a level above the contracting officer and placed in the contract file.
(d) In solicitations for negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer may require the submission of subcontracting plans with initial offers, or at any other time prior to award. In determining when subcontracting plans should be required, as well as when and with whom plans should be negotiated, the contracting officer must consider the integrity of the competitive process, the goal of affording maximum practicable opportunity for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns to participate, and the burden placed on offerors.
(e) A contract may have no more than one plan. When a modification meets the criteria in 19.702 for a plan, or an option is exercised, the goals associated with the modification or option shall be added to those in the existing subcontract plan.
19.705-3 Preparing the solicitation.
The contracting officer shall provide the Small Business Administration's (SBA  s) procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) a reasonable period of time to review any solicitation requiring submission of a subcontracting plan and to submit advisory findings before the solicitation is issued.
19.705-4 Reviewing the subcontracting plan.
The contracting officer shall review the subcontracting plan for adequacy, ensuring that the required information, goals, and assurances are included (see 19.704 ).
(a) No detailed standards apply to every subcontracting plan. Instead, the contracting officer shall consider each plan in terms of the circumstances of the particular acquisition, including  
(1) Previous involvement of small business concerns as prime contractors or subcontractors in similar acquisitions;
(2) Proven methods of involving small business concerns as subcontractors in similar acquisitions; and
(3) The relative success of methods the contractor intends to use to meet the goals and requirements of the plan, as evidenced by records maintained by contractors.
(b) If, under a sealed bid solicitation, a bidder submits a plan that does not cover each of the 11 required elements (see 19.704 ), the contracting officer shall advise the bidder of the deficiency and request submission of a revised plan by a specific date. If the bidder does not submit a plan that incorporates the required elements within the time allotted, the bidder shall be ineligible for award. If the plan, although responsive, evidences the bidder  s intention not to comply with its obligations under the clause at 52.219-8 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns, the contracting officer may find the bidder nonresponsible.
(c) In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer shall determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the negotiation of each of the 11 elements of the plan (see 19.704 ). Subcontracting goals should be set at a level that the parties reasonably expect can result from the offeror expending good faith efforts to use small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The contracting officer shall take particular care to ensure that the offeror has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of substantiating good faith efforts. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the identification of steps that, if taken, would be considered a good faith effort. No goal should be negotiated upward if it is apparent that a higher goal will significantly increase the Government  s cost or seriously impede the attainment of acquisition objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see 52.219-10 , Incentive Subcontracting Program), may be used when additional and unique contract effort, such as providing technical assistance, could significantly increase subcontract awards to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business concerns.
(d) In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan, the contracting officer should take the following actions:
(1) Obtain information available from the cognizant contract administration office, as provided for in 19.706 (a), and evaluate the offeror  s past performance in awarding subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. If information is not available on a specific type of product or service, evaluate the offeror  s overall past performance and consider the performance of other contractors on similar efforts.
(2) In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F)(iii) , ensure that the goals offered are attainable in relation to  
(i) The subcontracting opportunities available to the contractor, commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract;
(ii) The pool of eligible subcontractors available to fulfill the subcontracting opportunities; and
(iii) The actual performance of such contractor in fulfilling the subcontracting goals specified in prior plans.
(3) Ensure that the subcontracting goals are consistent with the offeror  s certified cost or pricing data or data other than certified cost or pricing data.
(4) Evaluate the offeror  s make-or-buy policy or program to ensure that it does not conflict with the offeror  s proposed subcontracting plan and is in the Government  s interest. If the contract involves products or services that are particularly specialized or not generally available in the commercial market, consider the offeror  s current capacity to perform the work and the possibility of reduced subcontracting opportunities.
(5) Evaluate subcontracting potential, considering the offeror  s make-or-buy policies or programs, the nature of the supplies or services to be subcontracted, the known availability of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in the geographical area where the work will be performed, and the potential contractor  s long-standing contractual relationship with its suppliers.
(6) Advise the offeror of available sources of information on potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors, as well as any specific concerns known to be potential subcontractors. If the offeror  s proposed goals are questionable, the contracting officer must emphasize that the information should be used to develop realistic and acceptable goals.
(7) Obtain advice and recommendations from the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) and the agency small business specialist.
19.705-5 Awards involving subcontracting plans.
(a) In making an award that requires a subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall be responsible for the following:
(1) Consider the contractor  s compliance with the subcontracting plans submitted on previous contracts as a factor in determining contractor responsibility.
(2) Assure that a subcontracting plan was submitted when required.
(3) Notify the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) of the opportunity to review the proposed contract (including the plan and supporting documentation). The notice shall be issued in sufficient time to provide the representative a reasonable time to review the material and submit advisory recommendations to the contracting officer. Failure of the representative to respond in a reasonable period of time shall not delay contract award.
(4) Determine any fee that may be payable if an incentive is used in conjunction with the subcontracting plan.
(5) Ensure that an acceptable plan is incorporated into and made a material part of the contract.
(b) Letter contracts and similar undefinitized instruments, which would otherwise meet the requirements of 19.702 (a)(1) and (2), shall contain at least a preliminary basic plan addressing the requirements of 19.704 and in such cases require the negotiation of the final plan within 90 days after award or before definitization, whichever occurs first.
19.705-6 Postaward responsibilities of the contracting officer.
After a contract or contract modification containing a subcontracting plan is awarded, the contracting officer who approved the plan is responsible for the following:
(a) Notifying the SBA of the award by sending a copy of the award document to the Area Director, Office of Government Contracting, in the SBA area office where the contract will be performed.
(b) Forwarding a copy of each commercial plan and any associated approvals to the Area Director, Office of Government Contracting, in the SBA area office where the contractor  s headquarters is located.
(c) Giving to the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) a copy of  
(1) Any subcontracting plan submitted in response to a sealed bid solicitation; and
(2) The final negotiated subcontracting plan that was incorporated into a negotiated contract or contract modification.
(d) Notifying the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) of the opportunity to review subcontracting plans in connection with contract modifications.
(e) Forwarding a copy of each plan, or a determination that there is no requirement for a subcontracting plan, to the cognizant contract administration office.
(f) Initiating action to assess liquidated damages in accordance with 19.705-7 upon a recommendation by the administrative contracting officer or receipt of other reliable evidence to indicate that such action is warranted.
(g) Taking action to enforce the terms of the contract upon receipt of a notice under 19.706 (f).
(h) Acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISR and the SSR in the eSRS. Acknowledging receipt does not mean acceptance or approval of the report. The report shall be rejected if it is not adequately completed, for instance, if there are errors, omissions, or incomplete data. Failure to meet the goals of the subcontracting plan is not a valid reason for rejecting the report.
19.705-7 Liquidated damages.
(a) Maximum practicable utilization of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.
(b) The amount of damages attributable to the contractor  s failure to comply shall be an amount equal to the actual dollar amount by which the contractor failed to achieve each subcontracting goal.
(c) If, at completion of the basic contract or any option, or in the case of a commercial plan, at the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable, a contractor has failed to meet its subcontracting goals, the contracting officer shall review all available information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort to comply with the plan. If no such indication is found, the contracting officer shall document the file accordingly. If the contracting officer decides in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising the contractor of the possibility that the contractor may have to pay to the Government liquidated damages, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period as necessary) within which to respond. The notice shall give the contractor an opportunity to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made before the contracting officer issues the final decision, and shall further state that failure of the contractor to respond may be taken as an admission that no valid explanation exists.
(d) In determining whether a contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, a contracting officer must look to the totality of the contractor  s actions, consistent with the information and assurances provided in its plan. The fact that the contractor failed to meet its subcontracting goals does not, in and of itself, constitute a failure to make a good faith effort. For example, notwithstanding a contractor  s diligent effort to identify and solicit offers from small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, factors such as unavailability of anticipated sources or unreasonable prices may frustrate achievement of the contractor  s goals. However, when considered in the context of the contractor  s total effort in accordance with its plan, the following, though not all inclusive, may be considered as indicators of a failure to make a good faith effort: a failure to attempt to identify, contact, solicit, or consider for contract award small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concerns; a failure to designate and maintain a company official to administer the subcontracting program and monitor and enforce compliance with the plan; a failure to submit the ISR, or the SSR, using the eSRS, or as provided in agency regulations; a failure to maintain records or otherwise demonstrate procedures adopted to comply with the plan; or the adoption of company policies or procedures that have as their objectives the frustration of the objectives of the plan.
(e) If, after consideration of all the pertinent data, the contracting officer finds that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision to the contractor to that effect and require the payment of liquidated damages in an amount stated. The contracting officer  s final decision shall state that the contractor has the right to appeal under the clause in the contract entitled Disputes.
(f) With respect to commercial plans approved under the clause at 52.219-9 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer that approved the plan shall  
(1) Perform the functions of the contracting officer under this subsection on behalf of all agencies with contracts covered by the commercial plan;
(2) Determine whether or not the goals in the commercial plan were achieved and, if they were not achieved, review all available information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort to comply with the plan, and document the results of the review;
(3) If a determination is made to assess liquidated damages, in order to calculate and assess the amount of damages, the contracting officer shall ask the contractor to provide  
(i) Contract numbers for the Government contracts subject to the plan;
(ii) The total Government sales during the contractor  s fiscal year; and
(iii) The amount of payments made under the Government contracts subject to that plan that contributed to the contractor  s total sales during the contractor  s fiscal year; and
(4) When appropriate, assess liquidated damages on the Government  s behalf, based on the pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts. For example: The contractor  s total actual sales were $50 million and its actual subcontracting was $20 million. The Government  s total payments under contracts subject to the plan contributing to the contractor  s total sales were $5 million, which accounted for 10 percent of the contractor  s total sales. Therefore, the pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts would be 10 percent of $20 million, or $2 million. To continue the example, if the contractor failed to achieve its small business goal by 1 percent, the liquidated damages would be calculated as 1 percent of $2 million, or $20,000. The contracting officer shall make similar calculations for each category of small business where the contractor failed to achieve its goal and the sum of the dollars for all of the categories equals the amount of the liquidated damages to be assessed. A copy of the contracting officer  s final decision assessing liquidated damages shall be provided to other contracting officers with contracts subject to the commercial plan.
(g) Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies that Government may have.
(h) Every contracting officer with a contract that is subject to a commercial plan shall include in the contract file a copy of the approved plan and a copy of the final decision assessing liquidating damages, if applicable.
19.706 Responsibilities of the cognizant administrative contracting officer.
The administrative contracting officer is responsible for assisting in evaluating subcontracting plans, and for monitoring, evaluating, and documenting contractor performance under the clause prescribed in 19.708 (b) and any subcontracting plan included in the contract. The contract administration office shall provide the necessary information and advice to support the contracting officer, as appropriate, by furnishing  
(a) Documentation on the contractor  s performance and compliance with subcontracting plans under previous contracts;
(b) Information on the extent to which the contractor is meeting the plan  s goals for subcontracting with eligible small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns;
(c) Information on whether the contractor  s efforts to ensure the participation of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns are in accordance with its subcontracting plan;
(d) Information on whether the contractor is requiring its subcontractors to adopt similar subcontracting plans;
(e) Immediate notice if, during performance, the contractor is failing to meet its commitments under the clause prescribed in 19.708 (b) or the subcontracting plan;
(f) Immediate notice and rationale if, during performance, the contractor is failing to comply in good faith with the subcontracting plan; and
(g) Immediate notice that performance under a contract is complete, that the goals were or were not met, and, if not met, whether there is any indication of a lack of a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting plan.
19.707 The Small Business Administration  s role in carrying out the program.
(a) Under the program, the SBA may  
(1) Assist both Government agencies and contractors in carrying out their responsibilities with regard to subcontracting plans;
(2) Review (within 5 working days) any solicitation that meets the dollar threshold in 19.702 (a)(1) or (2) before the solicitation is issued;
(3) Review (within 5 working days) before execution any negotiated contractual document requiring a subcontracting plan, including the plan itself, and submit recommendations to the contracting officer, which shall be advisory in nature; and
(4) Evaluate compliance with subcontracting plans, either on a contract-by-contract basis, or, in the case of contractors having multiple contracts, on an aggregate basis.
(b) The SBA is not authorized to  
(1) Prescribe the extent to which any contractor or subcontractor shall subcontract,
(2) Specify concerns to which subcontracts will be awarded, or
(3) Exercise any authority regarding the administration of individual prime contracts or subcontracts.
19.708 Contract clauses.
(a) Insert the clause at 52.219-8 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns, in solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold unless  
(1) A personal services contract is contemplated (see 37.104 ); or
(2) The contract, together with all of its subcontracts, will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas.
(b)(1) Insert the clause at 52.219-9 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations and contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities, are expected to exceed $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction of any public facility), and are required to include the clause at 52.219-8 , Utilization of Small Business Concerns, unless the acquisition is set aside or is to be accomplished under the 8(a) program. When  
(i) Contracting by sealed bidding rather than by negotiation, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate I.
(ii) Contracting by negotiation, and subcontracting plans are required with initial proposals as provided for in 19.705-2 (d), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II.
(iii) The contract action will not be reported in the Federal Procurement Data System pursuant to 4.606 (c)(5), or (c)(6), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate III.
(2) Insert the clause at 52.219-16 , Liquidated Damages  Subcontracting Plan, in all solicitations and contracts containing the clause at 52.219-9 , Small Business Subcontracting Plan, or the clause with its Alternate I, II, or III.
(c)(1) The contracting officer may, when contracting by negotiation, insert in solicitations and contracts a clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.219-10 , Incentive Subcontracting Program, when a subcontracting plan is required (see 19.702 ), and inclusion of a monetary incentive is, in the judgment of the contracting officer, necessary to increase subcontracting opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and women-owned small business concerns, and is commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract; unless the conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are applicable. The contracting officer may vary the terms of the clause as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) Various approaches may be used in the development of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and women-owned small business concerns  subcontracting incentives. They can take many forms, from a fully quantified schedule of payments based on actual subcontract achievement to an award-fee approach employing subjective evaluation criteria (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). The incentive should not reward the contractor for results other than those that are attributable to the contractor  s efforts under the incentive subcontracting program.
(3) As specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the contracting officer may include small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and women-owned small business subcontracting as one of the factors to be considered in determining the award fee in a cost-plus-award-fee contract; in such cases, however, the contracting officer shall not use the clause at 52.219-10 , Incentive Subcontracting Program.
