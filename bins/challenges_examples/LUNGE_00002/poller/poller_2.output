Subpart 4.10  Contract Line Items
4.1001 Policy.
Contracts may identify the items or services to be acquired as separately identified line items. Contract line items should provide unit prices or lump sum prices for separately identifiable contract deliverables, and associated delivery schedules or performance periods. Line items may be further subdivided or stratified for administrative purposes ( e.g., to provide for traceable accounting classification citations).

> > > > > Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Un
Subpart 22.12  Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts
22.1200 Scope of subpart.
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing Executive Order 13495 of January 30, 2009, Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts, and related Secretary of Labor regulations and instructions (see 29 CFR part 9).
22.1201 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
United States  means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and outer Continental Shelf as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331, et seq .), but does not include any other place subject to United States jurisdiction or any United States base or possession in a foreign country (see 29 CFR 4.112).
22.1202 Policy.
(a) When a service contract succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, as defined at 29 CFR 9.2, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. Executive Order 13495 generally prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided, when consistent with applicable law. 
(b) Nothing in Executive Order 13495 shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see subpart 19.13 ), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may, in certain circumstances, conflict with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495 and this subpart. 
22.1203 Applicability. 
22.1203-1 General.
This subpart applies to service contracts that succeed contracts for the same or similar services (29 CFR 9.2) at the same location.
22.1203-2 Exemptions.
(a) This subpart does not apply to  
(1) Contracts and subcontracts under the simplified acquisition threshold; 
(2) Contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to 41 U.S.C. chapter 85, Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled;
(3) Guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Government under contracts or subcontracts with sheltered workshops employing the  severely handicapped  as described in 40 U.S.C. 593;
(4) Agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the preference regulations issued under the Randolph Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or
(5) Service employees who were hired to work under a Federal service contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a single job, provided that the service employees were not deployed in a manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this subpart.
(b) The exemptions in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this subsection apply when either the predecessor or successor contract has been awarded for services produced or provided by the  severely handicapped.  
22.1203-3 Waiver.
(a) The senior procurement executive of the procuring agency may waive some or all of the provisions of this subpart after determining in writing that the application of this subpart would not serve the purposes of Executive Order 13495 or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis. Such waivers may be made for a contract, subcontract, or purchase order, or with respect to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders. See 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a waiver could or would not be appropriate. The waiver must be reflected in a written analysis as described in 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4)(i) and must be completed by the contract solicitation date, or the waiver is inoperative. The senior procurement executive shall not redelegate this waiver authority. 
(b)(1) When an agency exercises its waiver authority with respect to any contract, subcontract, or purchase order, the contracting officer shall direct the contractor to notify affected workers and their collective bargaining representative in writing, no later than five business days after the solicitation issuance date, of the agency  s determination. The notice shall include facts supporting the determination. The contracting officer  s failure to direct that the contractor provide the notice as provided in this subparagraph shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at 52.222-17 in the solicitation. 
(2) Where a contracting agency waives application to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders, the contracting officer shall, with respect to each individual solicitation, direct the contractor to notify incumbent workers and their collective bargaining representatives in writing, no later than five business days after each solicitation issuance date, of the agency  s determination. The notice shall include facts supporting the determination. The contracting officer  s failure to direct that the contractor provide the notice provided in this subparagraph shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at 52.222-17 in the solicitation.
(3) In addition, the agency shall notify the Department of Labor of its waiver decision and provide the Department of Labor with a copy of its written analysis no later than five business days after the solicitation issuance date (see 29 CFR 9.4(d)(2)). Failure to comply with this notification requirement shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at 52.222-17 in the solicitation. The waiver decision and related written analysis shall be sent to the following address: U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, 200 Constitution Avenue, Room S-3006, Washington, D.C. 20210, or email to: Displaced@dol.gov .
22.1203-4 Method of job offer.
A job offer made by a successor contractor must be a bona fide express offer of employment on the contract. Each bona fide express offer made to a qualified service employee on the predecessor contract must have a stated time limit of not less than 10 days for an employee response. Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period, the contractor is prohibited from offering employment on the contract to any other person, subject to the exceptions at 22.1203-5 . Any question concerning an employee  s qualifications shall be decided based upon the individual  s education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee  s experience on the predecessor contract, and a contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with the Executive Order. An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12(b) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a bona fide offer of employment can occur.)
22.1203-5 Exceptions.
(a) A successor contractor or its subcontractors are not required to offer employment to any service employee of the predecessor contractor who  
(1) Will be retained by the predecessor contractor. 
(2) The successor contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee  s past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job. (See 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which this exception would or would not be appropriate.) 
(b) A successor contractor or its subcontractors may employ under the contract any of its current service employees who (1) have worked for the successor contractor or its subcontractors for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of the successor contract, and (2) would otherwise face lay-off or discharge.
(c) The successor contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of the preceding exceptions and the exemption listed at 22.1203-2 (a)(5) involving nonfederal work.
22.1203-6 Reduced staffing.
A successor contractor and its subcontractors may employ fewer service employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. Thus, the successor contractor need not offer employment on the contract to all service employees on the predecessor contract, but must offer employment only to the number of eligible service employees the successor contractor believes necessary to meet its anticipated staffing pattern. Where a successor contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor  s first date of performance on the contract. (See 29 CFR 9.12(d) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which reduced staffing can occur.)
22.1204 Certified service employee lists. 
(a) Not less than 30 days before completion of the contract, the predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The certified list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and subcontracts for services. The information on this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by paragraph (n) of the clause at 52.222-41 , Service Contract Act of 1965. If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41 (n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion.
(b) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.
22.1205 Notification to contractors and service employees. 
(a) The contracting officer shall direct that the predecessor contractor provides written notice to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. The written notice shall be  
(1) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or
(2) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via e-mail, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. 
(b) Contracting officers may advise contractors to provide the notice in Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9. Where a significant portion of the predecessor contractor  s workforce is not fluent in English, the contractor shall provide the notice in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. English and Spanish versions of the notice are available on the Department of Labor website at http://www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts . 
22.1206 Remedies and sanctions for violations of this subpart. 
(a) The Secretary of Labor has the authority to issue orders prescribing appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, requiring the successor contractor to offer employment, in positions for which the employees are qualified, to service employees from the predecessor contract and payment of wages lost. (See 29 CFR 9.24(a)).
(b) After an investigation (see 29 CFR 9.23) and a determination by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, that lost wages or other monetary relief is due, the Administrator may direct that so much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government shall be withheld as are necessary to pay the monies due. Upon the final order of the Secretary of Labor that such monies are due, the Administrator may direct that such withheld funds be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement. (See 29 CFR 9.24(c)). 
(c) If the contracting officer or the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, finds that the predecessor contractor has failed to provide the list required by 22.1204 , the contracting officer may, in his or her discretion, or on request by the Administrator, suspend contract payment until such time as the contractor provides the list to the contracting officer.
(d) The Secretary of Labor may also suspend or debar a contractor or subcontractor for a period of up to three years for violations of 29 CFR part 9. 
22.1207 Contract clause.
The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.222-17 , Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers, in solicitations and contracts for (1) service contracts, as defined at 22.001 , (2) that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same location and (3) that are not exempted by 22.1203-2 or waived in accordance with 22.1203-3 .

Subpart 22.12  Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts
22.1200 Scope of subpart.
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing Executive Order 13495 of January 30, 2009, Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts, and related Secretary of Labor regulations and instructions (see 29 CFR part 9).
22.1201 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
United States  means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and outer Continental Shelf as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331, et seq .), but does not include any other place subject to United States jurisdiction or any United States base or possession in a foreign country (see 29 CFR 4.112).
22.1202 Policy.
(a) When a service contract succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, as defined at 29 CFR 9.2, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. Executive Order 13495 generally prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided, when consistent with applicable law. 
(b) Nothing in Executive Order 13495 shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see subpart 19.13 ), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may, in certain circumstances, conflict with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495 and this subpart. 
22.1203 Applicability. 
22.1203-1 General.
This subpart applies to service contracts that succeed contracts for the same or similar services (29 CFR 9.2) at the same location.
22.1203-2 Exemptions.
(a) This subpart does not apply to  
(1) Contracts and subcontracts under the simplified acquisition threshold; 
(2) Contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to 41 U.S.C. chapter 85, Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled;
(3) Guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Government under contracts or subcontracts with sheltered workshops employing the  severely handicapped  as described in 40 U.S.C. 593;
(4) Agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the preference regulations issued under the Randolph Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or
(5) Service employees who were hired to work under a Federal service contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a single job, provided that the service employees were not deployed in a manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this subpart.
(b) The exemptions in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this subsection apply when either the predecessor or successor contract has been awarded for services produced or provided by the  severely handicapped.  
22.1203-3 Waiver.
(a) The senior procurement executive of the procuring agency may waive some or all of the provisions of this subpart after determining in writing that the application of this subpart would not serve the purposes of Executive Order 13495 or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis. Such waivers may be made for a contract, subcontract, or purchase order, or with respect to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders. See 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a waiver could or would not be appropriate. The waiver must be reflected in a written analysis as described in 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4)(i) and must be completed by the contract solicitation date, or the waiver is inoperative. The senior procurement executive shall not redelegate this waiver authority. 
(b)(1) When an agency exercises its waiver authority with respect to any contract, subcontract, or purchase order, the contracting officer shall direct the contractor to notify affected workers and their collective bargaining representative in writing, no later than five business days after the solicitation issuance date, of the agency  s determination. The notice shall include facts supporting the determination. The contracting officer  s failure to direct that the contractor provide the notice as provided in this subparagraph shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at 52.222-17 in the solicitation. 
(2) Where a contracting agency waives application to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders, the contracting officer shall, with respect to each individual solicitation, direct the contractor to notify incumbent workers and their collective bargaining representatives in writing, no later than five business days after each solicitation issuance date, of the agency  s determination. The notice shall include facts supporting the determination. The contracting officer  s failure to direct that the contractor provide the notice provided in this subparagraph shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at 52.222-17 in the solicitation.
(3) In addition, the agency shall notify the Department of Labor of its waiver decision and provide the Department of Labor with a copy of its written analysis no later than five business days after the solicitation issuance date (see 29 CFR 9.4(d)(2)). Failure to comply with this notification requirement shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at 52.222-17 in the solicitation. The waiver decision and related written analysis shall be sent to the following address: U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, 200 Constitution Avenue, Room S-3006, Washington, D.C. 20210, or email to: Displaced@dol.gov .
22.1203-4 Method of job offer.
A job offer made by a successor contractor must be a bona fide express offer of employment on the contract. Each bona fide express offer made to a qualified service employee on the predecessor contract must have a stated time limit of not less than 10 days for an employee response. Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period, the contractor is prohibited from offering employment on the contract to any other person, subject to the exceptions at 22.1203-5 . Any question concerning an employee  s qualifications shall be decided based upon the individual  s education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee  s experience on the predecessor contract, and a contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with the Executive Order. An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits. (See 29 CFR 9.12(b) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a bona fide offer of employment can occur.)
22.1203-5 Exceptions.
(a) A successor contractor or its subcontractors are not required to offer employment to any service employee of the predecessor contractor who  
(1) Will be retained by the predecessor contractor. 
(2) The successor contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee  s past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job. (See 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which this exception would or would not be appropriate.) 
(b) A successor contractor or its subcontractors may employ under the contract any of its current service employees who (1) have worked for the successor contractor or its subcontractors for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of the successor contract, and (2) would otherwise face lay-off or discharge.
(c) The successor contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of the preceding exceptions and the exemption listed at 22.1203-2 (a)(5) involving nonfederal work.
22.1203-6 Reduced staffing.
A successor contractor and its subcontractors may employ fewer service employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. Thus, the successor contractor need not offer employment on the contract to all service employees on the predecessor contract, but must offer employment only to the number of eligible service employees the successor contractor believes necessary to meet its anticipated staffing pattern. Where a successor contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor  s first date of performance on the contract. (See 29 CFR 9.12(d) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which reduced staffing can occur.)
22.1204 Certified service employee lists. 
(a) Not less than 30 days before completion of the contract, the predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted. The certified list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and subcontracts for services. The information on this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by paragraph (n) of the clause at 52.222-41 , Service Contract Act of 1965. If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of 52.222-41 (n) are met. When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion.
(b) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.
22.1205 Notification to contractors and service employees. 
(a) The contracting officer shall direct that the predecessor contractor provides written notice to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor. The written notice shall be  
(1) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or
(2) Delivered to the service employees individually. If such delivery is via e-mail, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. 
(b) Contracting officers may advise contractors to provide the notice in Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9. Where a significant portion of the predecessor contractor  s workforce is not fluent in English, the contractor shall provide the notice in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar. English and Spanish versions of the notice are available on the Department of Labor website at http://www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts . 
22.1206 Remedies and sanctions for violations of this subpart. 
(a) The Secretary of Labor has the authority to issue orders prescribing appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, requiring the successor contractor to offer employment, in positions for which the employees are qualified, to service employees from the predecessor contract and payment of wages lost. (See 29 CFR 9.24(a)).
(b) After an investigation (see 29 CFR 9.23) and a determination by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, that lost wages or other monetary relief is due, the Administrator may direct that so much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government shall be withheld as are necessary to pay the monies due. Upon the final order of the Secretary of Labor that such monies are due, the Administrator may direct that such withheld funds be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement. (See 29 CFR 9.24(c)). 
(c) If the contracting officer or the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, finds that the predecessor contractor has failed to provide the list required by 22.1204 , the contracting officer may, in his or her discretion, or on request by the Administrator, suspend contract payment until such time as the contractor provides the list to the contracting officer.
(d) The Secretary of Labor may also suspend or debar a contractor or subcontractor for a period of up to three years for violations of 29 CFR part 9. 
22.1207 Contract clause.
The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.222-17 , Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers, in solicitations and contracts for (1) service contracts, as defined at 22.001 , (2) that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same location and (3) that are not exempted by 22.1203-2 or waived in accordance with 22.1203-3 .

Subpart 9.2  Qualifications Requirements
9.200 Scope of subpart.
This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2319 and 41 U.S.C.253c and prescribes policies and procedures regarding qualification requirements and the acquisitions that are subject to such requirements.
9.201 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
Qualified bidders list (QBL)  means a list of bidders who have had their products examined and tested and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements for that product or have otherwise satisfied all applicable qualification requirements.
Qualified manufacturers list (QML)  means a list of manufacturers who have had their products examined and tested and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements for that product.
9.202 Policy.
(a)(1) The head of the agency or designee shall, before establishing a qualification requirement, prepare a written justification  
(i) Stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specifying why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;
(ii) Estimating the likely costs for testing and evaluation which will be incurred by the potential offeror to become qualified; and
(iii) Specifying all requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified. Only those requirements which are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirements shall be specified.
(2) Upon request to the contracting activity, potential offerors shall be provided  
(i) All requirements that they or their products must satisfy to become qualified; and
(ii) At their expense (but see 9.204 (a)(2) with regard to small businesses), a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned, or of another agency obtained through interagency agreements or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency).
(3) If the services in (a)(2)(ii) of this section are provided by contract, the contractors selected to provide testing and evaluation services shall be  
(i) Those that are not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources; and
(ii) Required by their contracts to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification.
(4) A potential offeror seeking qualification shall be promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event it is not, promptly furnished specific reasons why qualification was not attained.
(b) When justified under the circumstances, the agency activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement shall submit to the competition advocate for the procuring activity responsible for purchasing the item subject to the qualification requirement, a determination that it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror (or its product) must satisfy. After considering any comments of the competition advocate reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of 9.202 (a)(1)(ii) through (4) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement. A copy of the waiver shall be furnished to the head of the agency or other official responsible for actions under 9.202 (a)(1). The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to qualification requirements contained in a QPL, QML, or QBL.
(c) If a potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror (or its product) meets the standards established for qualification or can meet them before the date specified for award of the contract, a potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror  
(1) Is not on a QPL, QML, or QBL maintained by the Department of Defense (DoD) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); or
(2) Has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19, 1984, by DoD or NASA; or
(3) Has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established by a civilian agency (not including NASA).
(d) The procedures in Subpart 19.6 for referring matters to the Small Business Administration are not mandatory on the contracting officer when the basis for a referral would involve a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror  s compliance with such requirement.
(e) The contracting officer need not delay a proposed award in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification. In addition, when approved by the head of an agency or designee, a procurement need not be delayed in order to comply with 9.202 (a).
(f) Within 7 years following enforcement of a QPL, QML, or QBL by DoD or NASA, or within 7 years after any qualification requirement was originally established by a civilian agency other than NASA, the qualification requirement shall be examined and revalidated in accordance with the requirements of 9.202 (a). For DoD and NASA, qualification requirements other than QPL  s, QML  s and QBL  s shall be examined and revalidated within 7 years after establishment of the requirement under 9.202 (a). Any periods for which a waiver under 9.202 (b) is in effect shall be excluded in computing the 7 years within which review and revalidation must occur.
9.203 QPL  s, QML  s, and QBL  s.
(a) Qualification and listing in a QPL, QML, or QBL is the process by which products are obtained from manufacturers or distributors, examined and tested for compliance with specification requirements, or manufacturers or potential offerors, are provided an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. The names of successful products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included on lists evidencing their status. Generally, qualification is performed in advance and independently of any specific acquisition action. After qualification, the products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included in a Federal or Military QPL, QML, or QBL. (See 9.202 (a)(2) with regard to any product, manufacturer, or potential offeror not yet included on an applicable list.)
(b) Specifications requiring a qualified product are included in the following publications:
(1) GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR 101-29.1.
(2) Department of Defense Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST) at ( http://assist.daps.dla.mil ).
(c) Instructions concerning qualification procedures are included in the following publications:
(1) Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001.
(2) Defense Standardization Manual 4120.24-M, Appendix 2, as amended by Military Standards 961 and 962.
(d) The publications listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are sold to the public. The publications in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section may be obtained from the addressee in 11.201 (d)(1). The publications in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section may be obtained from the addressee in 11.201 (d)(2).
9.204 Responsibilities for establishment of a qualification requirement.
The responsibilities of agency activities that establish qualification requirements include the following:
(a) Arranging publicity for the qualification requirements. If active competition on anticipated future qualification requirements is likely to be fewer than two manufacturers or the products of two manufacturers, the activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirements must  
(1) Periodically furnish through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) a notice seeking additional sources or products for qualification unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise the national security.
(2) Bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement. However, such costs may be borne only if it is determined in accordance with agency procedures that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period of time, considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements. A prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs must certify as to its status as a small business concern under Section 3 of the Small Business Act in order to receive further consideration.
(b) Qualifying products that meet specification requirements.
(c) Listing manufacturers and suppliers whose products are qualified in accordance with agency procedures.
(d) Furnishing QPL  s, QML  s, or QBL  s or the qualification requirements themselves to prospective offerors and the public upon request (see 9.202 (a)(2)(i)).
(e) Clarifying, as necessary, qualification requirements.
(f) In appropriate cases, when requested by the contracting officer, providing concurrence in a decision not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation.
(g) Withdrawing or omitting qualification of a listed product, manufacturer or offeror, as necessary.
(h) Advising persons furnished any list of products, manufacturers or offerors meeting a qualification requirement and suppliers whose products are on any such list that  
(1) The list does not constitute endorsement of the product, manufacturer, or other source by the Government;
(2) The products or sources listed have been qualified under the latest applicable specification;
(3) The list may be amended without notice;
(4) The listing of a product or source does not release the supplier from compliance with the specification; and
(5) Use of the list for advertising or publicity is permitted. However, it must not be stated or implied that a particular product or source is the only product or source of that type qualified, or that the Government in any way recommends or endorses the products or the sources listed.
(i) Reexamining a qualified product or manufacturer when  
(1) The manufacturer has modified its product, or changed the material or the processing sufficiently so that the validity of previous qualification is questionable;
(2) The requirements in the specification have been amended or revised sufficiently to affect the character of the product; or
(3) It is otherwise necessary to determine that the quality of the product is maintained in conformance with the specification.
9.205 Opportunity for qualification before award.
(a) If an agency determines that a qualification requirement is necessary, the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement must urge manufacturers and other potential sources to demonstrate their ability to meet the standards specified for qualification and, when possible, give sufficient time to arrange for qualification before award. The responsible agency activity must, before establishing any qualification requirement, furnish notice through the GPE. The notice must include  
(1) Intent to establish a qualification requirement;
(2) The specification number and name of the product;
(3) The name and address of the activity to which a request for the information and opportunity described in 9.202 (a)(2) should be submitted;
(4) The anticipated date that the agency will begin awarding contracts subject to the qualification requirement;
(5) A precautionary notice that when a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin; and
(6) The approximate time period following submission of a product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing (see 9.202 (a)(4)).
(b) The activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement must keep any list maintained of those already qualified open for inclusion of additional products, manufacturers, or other potential sources.
9.206 Acquisitions subject to qualification requirements.
9.206-1 General.
(a) Agencies may not enforce any QPL, QML, or QBL without first complying with the requirements of 9.202 (a). However, qualification requirements themselves, whether or not previously embodied in a in a QPL, QML, or QBL, may be enforced without regard to 9.202 (a) if they are in either of the following categories:
(1) Any qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984, for civilian agencies (not including NASA); or
(2) Any qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action prior to October 19, 1984, for DoD or NASA. Qualification requirements established after the above dates must comply with 9.202 (a) to be enforceable.
(b) Except when the agency head or designee determines that an emergency exists, whenever an agency elects, whether before or after award, not to enforce a qualification requirement which it established, the requirement may not thereafter be enforced unless the agency complies with 9.202 (a).
(c) If a qualification requirement applies, the contracting officer need consider only those offers identified as meeting the requirement or included on the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL, unless an offeror can satisfactorily demonstrate to the contracting officer that it or its product or its subcontractor or its product can meet the standards established for qualification before the date specified for award.
(d) If a product subject to a qualification requirement is to be acquired as a component of an end item, the contracting officer must ensure that all such components and their qualification requirements are properly identified in the solicitation since the product or source must meet the standards specified for qualification before award.
(e) In acquisitions subject to qualification requirements, the contracting officer shall take the following steps:
(1) Use presolicitation notices in appropriate cases to advise potential suppliers before issuing solicitations involving qualification requirements. The notices shall identify the specification containing the qualification requirement and establish an allowable time period, consistent with delivery requirements, for prospective offerors to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. The notice shall be publicized in accordance with 5.204 . Whether or not a presolicitation notice is used, the general synopsizing requirements of Subpart 5.2 apply.
(2) Distribute solicitations to prospective contractors whether or not they have been identified as meeting applicable qualification requirements.
(3) When appropriate, request in accordance with agency procedures that a qualification requirement not be enforced in a particular acquisition and, if granted, so specify in the solicitation (see 9.206-1 (b)).
(4) Forward requests from potential suppliers for information on a qualification requirement to the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement.
(5) Allow the maximum time, consistent with delivery requirements, between issuing the solicitation and the contract award. As a minimum, contracting officers shall comply with the time frames specified in 5.203 when applicable.
9.206-2 Contract clause.
The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.209-1 , Qualification Requirements, in solicitations and contracts when the acquisition is subject to a qualification requirement.
9.206-3 Competition.
(a) Presolicitation . If a qualification requirement applies to an acquisition, the contracting officer shall review the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL or other identification of those sources which have met the requirement before issuing a solicitation to ascertain whether the number of sources is adequate for competition. (See 9.204 (a) for duties of the agency activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirement.) If the number of sources is inadequate, the contracting officer shall request the agency activity which established the requirement to  
(1) Indicate the anticipated date on which any sources presently undergoing evaluation will have demonstrated their abilities to meet the qualification requirement so that the solicitation could be rescheduled to allow as many additional sources as possible to qualify; or
(2) Indicate whether a means other than the qualification requirement is feasible for testing or demonstrating quality assurance.
(b) Post solicitation . The contracting officer shall submit to the agency activity which established the qualification requirement the names and addresses of concerns which expressed interest in the acquisition but are not included on the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL or identified as meeting the qualification requirement. The activity will then assist interested concerns in meeting the standards specified for qualification (see 9.202 (a)(2) and (4)).
9.207 Changes in status regarding qualification requirements.
(a) The contracting officer shall promptly report to the agency activity which established the qualification requirement any conditions which may merit removal or omission from a QPL, QML, or QBL or affect whether a source should continue to be otherwise identified as meeting the requirement. These conditions exist when  
(1) Products or services are submitted for inspection or acceptance that do not meet the qualification requirement;
(2) Products or services were previously rejected and the defects were not corrected when submitted for inspection or acceptance;
(3) A supplier fails to request reevaluation following change of location or ownership of the plant where the product which met the qualification requirement was manufactured (see the clause at 52.209-1 , Qualification Requirements);
(4) A manufacturer of a product which met the qualification requirement has discontinued manufacture of the product;
(5) A source requests removal from a QPL, QML, or QBL;
(6) A condition of meeting the qualification requirement was violated; e.g., advertising or publicity contrary to 9.204 (h)(5);
(7) A revised specification imposes a new qualification requirement;
(8) Manufacturing or design changes have been incorporated in the qualification requirement;
(9) The source is listed in the System for Award Management Exclusions (see Subpart 9.4 ); or
(10) Performance of a contract subject to a qualification requirement is otherwise unsatisfactory.
(b) After considering any of the above or other conditions reasonably related to whether a product or source continues to meet the standards specified for qualification, an agency may take appropriate action without advance notification. The agency shall, however, promptly notify the affected parties if a product or source is removed from a QPL, QML, or QBL, or will no longer be identified as meeting the standards specified for qualification. This notice shall contain specific information why the product or source no longer meets the qualification requirement.

> Qualifications Requirements
Subpart 9.2  Qualifications Requirements
9.200 Scope of subpart.
This subpart implements 10 U.S.C. 2319 and 41 U.S.C.253c and prescribes policies and procedures regarding qualification requirements and the acquisitions that are subject to such requirements.
9.201 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
Qualified bidders list (QBL)  means a list of bidders who have had their products examined and tested and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements for that product or have otherwise satisfied all applicable qualification requirements.
Qualified manufacturers list (QML)  means a list of manufacturers who have had their products examined and tested and who have satisfied all applicable qualification requirements for that product.
9.202 Policy.
(a)(1) The head of the agency or designee shall, before establishing a qualification requirement, prepare a written justification  
(i) Stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specifying why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;
(ii) Estimating the likely costs for testing and evaluation which will be incurred by the potential offeror to become qualified; and
(iii) Specifying all requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified. Only those requirements which are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirements shall be specified.
(2) Upon request to the contracting activity, potential offerors shall be provided  
(i) All requirements that they or their products must satisfy to become qualified; and
(ii) At their expense (but see 9.204 (a)(2) with regard to small businesses), a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned, or of another agency obtained through interagency agreements or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency).
(3) If the services in (a)(2)(ii) of this section are provided by contract, the contractors selected to provide testing and evaluation services shall be  
(i) Those that are not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources; and
(ii) Required by their contracts to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification.
(4) A potential offeror seeking qualification shall be promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event it is not, promptly furnished specific reasons why qualification was not attained.
(b) When justified under the circumstances, the agency activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement shall submit to the competition advocate for the procuring activity responsible for purchasing the item subject to the qualification requirement, a determination that it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror (or its product) must satisfy. After considering any comments of the competition advocate reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of 9.202 (a)(1)(ii) through (4) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement. A copy of the waiver shall be furnished to the head of the agency or other official responsible for actions under 9.202 (a)(1). The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to qualification requirements contained in a QPL, QML, or QBL.
(c) If a potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror (or its product) meets the standards established for qualification or can meet them before the date specified for award of the contract, a potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror  
(1) Is not on a QPL, QML, or QBL maintained by the Department of Defense (DoD) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); or
(2) Has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established after October 19, 1984, by DoD or NASA; or
(3) Has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement established by a civilian agency (not including NASA).
(d) The procedures in Subpart 19.6 for referring matters to the Small Business Administration are not mandatory on the contracting officer when the basis for a referral would involve a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror  s compliance with such requirement.
(e) The contracting officer need not delay a proposed award in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification. In addition, when approved by the head of an agency or designee, a procurement need not be delayed in order to comply with 9.202 (a).
(f) Within 7 years following enforcement of a QPL, QML, or QBL by DoD or NASA, or within 7 years after any qualification requirement was originally established by a civilian agency other than NASA, the qualification requirement shall be examined and revalidated in accordance with the requirements of 9.202 (a). For DoD and NASA, qualification requirements other than QPL  s, QML  s and QBL  s shall be examined and revalidated within 7 years after establishment of the requirement under 9.202 (a). Any periods for which a waiver under 9.202 (b) is in effect shall be excluded in computing the 7 years within which review and revalidation must occur.
9.203 QPL  s, QML  s, and QBL  s.
(a) Qualification and listing in a QPL, QML, or QBL is the process by which products are obtained from manufacturers or distributors, examined and tested for compliance with specification requirements, or manufacturers or potential offerors, are provided an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. The names of successful products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included on lists evidencing their status. Generally, qualification is performed in advance and independently of any specific acquisition action. After qualification, the products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included in a Federal or Military QPL, QML, or QBL. (See 9.202 (a)(2) with regard to any product, manufacturer, or potential offeror not yet included on an applicable list.)
(b) Specifications requiring a qualified product are included in the following publications:
(1) GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR 101-29.1.
(2) Department of Defense Acquisition Streamlining and Standardization Information System (ASSIST) at ( http://assist.daps.dla.mil ).
(c) Instructions concerning qualification procedures are included in the following publications:
(1) Federal Standardization Manual, FSPM-0001.
(2) Defense Standardization Manual 4120.24-M, Appendix 2, as amended by Military Standards 961 and 962.
(d) The publications listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are sold to the public. The publications in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) of this section may be obtained from the addressee in 11.201 (d)(1). The publications in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section may be obtained from the addressee in 11.201 (d)(2).
9.204 Responsibilities for establishment of a qualification requirement.
The responsibilities of agency activities that establish qualification requirements include the following:
(a) Arranging publicity for the qualification requirements. If active competition on anticipated future qualification requirements is likely to be fewer than two manufacturers or the products of two manufacturers, the activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirements must  
(1) Periodically furnish through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) a notice seeking additional sources or products for qualification unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise the national security.
(2) Bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement. However, such costs may be borne only if it is determined in accordance with agency procedures that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period of time, considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements. A prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs must certify as to its status as a small business concern under Section 3 of the Small Business Act in order to receive further consideration.
(b) Qualifying products that meet specification requirements.
(c) Listing manufacturers and suppliers whose products are qualified in accordance with agency procedures.
(d) Furnishing QPL  s, QML  s, or QBL  s or the qualification requirements themselves to prospective offerors and the public upon request (see 9.202 (a)(2)(i)).
(e) Clarifying, as necessary, qualification requirements.
(f) In appropriate cases, when requested by the contracting officer, providing concurrence in a decision not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation.
(g) Withdrawing or omitting qualification of a listed product, manufacturer or offeror, as necessary.
(h) Advising persons furnished any list of products, manufacturers or offerors meeting a qualification requirement and suppliers whose products are on any such list that  
(1) The list does not constitute endorsement of the product, manufacturer, or other source by the Government;
(2) The products or sources listed have been qualified under the latest applicable specification;
(3) The list may be amended without notice;
(4) The listing of a product or source does not release the supplier from compliance with the specification; and
(5) Use of the list for advertising or publicity is permitted. However, it must not be stated or implied that a particular product or source is the only product or source of that type qualified, or that the Government in any way recommends or endorses the products or the sources listed.
(i) Reexamining a qualified product or manufacturer when  
(1) The manufacturer has modified its product, or changed the material or the processing sufficiently so that the validity of previous qualification is questionable;
(2) The requirements in the specification have been amended or revised sufficiently to affect the character of the product; or
(3) It is otherwise necessary to determine that the quality of the product is maintained in conformance with the specification.
9.205 Opportunity for qualification before award.
(a) If an agency determines that a qualification requirement is necessary, the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement must urge manufacturers and other potential sources to demonstrate their ability to meet the standards specified for qualification and, when possible, give sufficient time to arrange for qualification before award. The responsible agency activity must, before establishing any qualification requirement, furnish notice through the GPE. The notice must include  
(1) Intent to establish a qualification requirement;
(2) The specification number and name of the product;
(3) The name and address of the activity to which a request for the information and opportunity described in 9.202 (a)(2) should be submitted;
(4) The anticipated date that the agency will begin awarding contracts subject to the qualification requirement;
(5) A precautionary notice that when a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin; and
(6) The approximate time period following submission of a product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing (see 9.202 (a)(4)).
(b) The activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement must keep any list maintained of those already qualified open for inclusion of additional products, manufacturers, or other potential sources.
9.206 Acquisitions subject to qualification requirements.
9.206-1 General.
(a) Agencies may not enforce any QPL, QML, or QBL without first complying with the requirements of 9.202 (a). However, qualification requirements themselves, whether or not previously embodied in a in a QPL, QML, or QBL, may be enforced without regard to 9.202 (a) if they are in either of the following categories:
(1) Any qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984, for civilian agencies (not including NASA); or
(2) Any qualification requirement established by statute or administrative action prior to October 19, 1984, for DoD or NASA. Qualification requirements established after the above dates must comply with 9.202 (a) to be enforceable.
(b) Except when the agency head or designee determines that an emergency exists, whenever an agency elects, whether before or after award, not to enforce a qualification requirement which it established, the requirement may not thereafter be enforced unless the agency complies with 9.202 (a).
(c) If a qualification requirement applies, the contracting officer need consider only those offers identified as meeting the requirement or included on the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL, unless an offeror can satisfactorily demonstrate to the contracting officer that it or its product or its subcontractor or its product can meet the standards established for qualification before the date specified for award.
(d) If a product subject to a qualification requirement is to be acquired as a component of an end item, the contracting officer must ensure that all such components and their qualification requirements are properly identified in the solicitation since the product or source must meet the standards specified for qualification before award.

(3) When appropriate, request in accordance with agency procedures that a qualification requirement not be enforced in a particular acquisition and, if granted, so specify in the solicitation (see 9.206-1 (b)).
(4) Forward requests from potential suppliers for information on a qualification requirement to the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement.
(5) Allow the maximum time, consistent with delivery requirements, between issuing the solicitation and the contract award. As a minimum, contracting officers shall comply with the time frames specified in 5.203 when applicable.
9.206-2 Contract clause.
The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.209-1 , Qualification Requirements, in solicitations and contracts when the acquisition is subject to a qualification requirement.
9.206-3 Competition.
(a) Presolicitation . If a qualification requirement applies to an acquisition, the contracting officer shall review the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL or other identification of those sources which have met the requirement before issuing a solicitation to ascertain whether the number of sources is adequate for competition. (See 9.204 (a) for duties of the agency activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirement.)

9.207 Changes in status regarding qualification requirements.
(a) The contracting officer shall promptly report to the agency activity which established the qualification requirement any conditions which may merit removal or omission from a QPL, QML, or QBL or affect whether a source should continue to be otherwise identified as meeting the requirement. These conditions exist when  
(1) Products or services are submitted for inspection or acceptance that do not meet the qualification requirement;

Subpart 8.5  Acquisition of Helium
8.500 Scope of subpart.
This subpart implements the requirements of the Helium Act ( 50 U.S.C. 167 , et seq .) concerning the acquisition of liquid or gaseous helium by Federal agencies or by Government contractors or subcontractors for use in the performance of a Government contract (also see 43 CFR Part 3195).
8.501 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
Bureau of Land Management  means the  
Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management Amarillo Field Office Helium Operations 801 South Fillmore Street Suite 500 Amarillo, TX 79101-3545.
Federal helium supplier  means a private helium vendor that has an in-kind crude helium sales contract with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and that is on the BLM Amarillo Field Office  s Authorized List of Federal Helium Suppliers available via the Internet at http://blm.gov/8pjd .
Major helium requirement  means an estimated refined helium requirement greater than 200,000 standard cubic feet (scf) (measured at 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute pressure and 70 degrees Fahrenheit temperature) of gaseous helium or 7510 liters of liquid helium delivered to a helium use location per year.
8.502 Policy.
Agencies and their contractors and subcontractors must purchase major helium requirements from Federal helium suppliers, to the extent that supplies are available.
8.503 Exception.
The requirements of this subpart do not apply to contracts or subcontracts in which the helium was acquired by the contractor prior to award of the contract or subcontract.
8.504 Procedures.
The contracting officer must forward the following information to the Bureau of Land Management within 45 days of the close of each fiscal quarter:
(a) The name of any company that supplied a major helium requirement.
(b) The amount of helium purchased.
(c) The delivery date(s).
(d) The location where the helium was used.
8.505 Contract clause.
Insert the clause at 52.208-8 , Required Sources for Helium and Helium Usage Data, in solicitations and contracts if it is anticipated that performance of the contract involves a major helium requirement.

Subpart 13.2  Actions At or Below the Micro-Purchase Threshold
13.201 General.
(a) Agency heads are encouraged to delegate micro-purchase authority (see 1.603-3 ).
(b) The Governmentwide commercial purchase card shall be the preferred method to purchase and to pay for micro-purchases (see 2.101 ).
(c) Purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold may be conducted using any of the methods described in Subpart 13.3 , provided the purchaser is authorized and trained, pursuant to agency procedures, to use those methods.
(d) Micro-purchases do not require provisions or clauses, except as provided at 13.202 and 32.1110 . This paragraph takes precedence over any other FAR requirement to the contrary, but does not prohibit the use of any clause.
(e) The requirements in Part 8 apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold.
(f) The procurement requirements in subparts 23.1 , 23.2 , 23.4 , and 23.7 apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold.
(g)(1) For acquisitions of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used to support a contingency operation or to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack, the micro-purchase threshold is  
(i) $15,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, inside the United States; and
(ii) $30,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States.
(2) Purchases using this authority must have a clear and direct relationship to the support of a contingency operation or the defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack.
(h) When using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment, purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold are exempt from verification in the System for Award Management database as to whether the contractor has a delinquent debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP).
13.202 Unenforceability of unauthorized obligations in micro-purchases.
Many supplies or services are acquired subject to supplier license agreements. These are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, but they may apply to any supply or service. For example, computer software and services delivered through the internet (web services) are often subject to license agreements, referred to as End User License Agreements (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Many of these agreements contain indemnification clauses that are inconsistent with Federal law and unenforceable, but which could create a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) if agreed to by the Government. The clause at 52.232-39 , Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations, automatically applies to any micro-purchase, including those made with the Governmentwide purchase card. This clause prevents such violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341).
13.203 Purchase guidelines.
(a) Solicitation, evaluation of quotations, and award.
(1) To the extent practicable, micro-purchases shall be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers.
(2) Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotations if the contracting officer or individual appointed in accordance with 1.603-3 (b) considers the price to be reasonable.
(3) The administrative cost of verifying the reasonableness of the price for purchases may more than offset potential savings from detecting instances of overpricing. Therefore, action to verify price reasonableness need only be taken if  
(i) The contracting officer or individual appointed in accordance with 1.603-3 (b) suspects or has information to indicate that the price may not be reasonable ( e.g., comparison to the previous price paid or personal knowledge of the supply or service); or
(ii) Purchasing a supply or service for which no comparable pricing information is readily available ( e.g., a supply or service that is not the same as, or is not similar to, other supplies or services that have recently been purchased on a competitive basis).
(b) Documentation. If competitive quotations were solicited and award was made to other than the low quoter, documentation to support the purchase may be limited to identification of the solicited concerns and an explanation for the award decision.

> Actions At or Below the Micro-Purchase
Subpart 13.2  Actions At or Below the Micro-Purchase Threshold
13.201 General.
(a) Agency heads are encouraged to delegate micro-purchase authority (see 1.603-3 ).
(b) The Governmentwide commercial purchase card shall be the preferred method to purchase and to pay for micro-purchases (see 2.101 ).
(c) Purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold may be conducted using any of the methods described in Subpart 13.3 , provided the purchaser is authorized and trained, pursuant to agency procedures, to use those methods.
(d) Micro-purchases do not require provisions or clauses, except as provided at 13.202 and 32.1110 . This paragraph takes precedence over any other FAR requirement to the contrary, but does not prohibit the use of any clause.
(e) The requirements in Part 8 apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold.
(f) The procurement requirements in subparts 23.1 , 23.2 , 23.4 , and 23.7 apply to purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold.
(g)(1) For acquisitions of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used to support a contingency operation or to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack, the micro-purchase threshold is  
(i) $15,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, inside the United States; and
(ii) $30,000 in the case of any contract to be awarded and performed, or purchase to be made, outside the United States.
(2) Purchases using this authority must have a clear and direct relationship to the support of a contingency operation or the defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack.
(h) When using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment, purchases at or below the micro-purchase threshold are exempt from verification in the System for Award Management database as to whether the contractor has a delinquent debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP).
13.202 Unenforceability of unauthorized obligations in micro-purchases.
Many supplies or services are acquired subject to supplier license agreements. These are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, but they may apply to any supply or service. For example, computer software and services delivered through the internet (web services) are often subject to license agreements, referred to as End User License Agreements (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Many of these agreements contain indemnification clauses that are inconsistent with Federal law and unenforceable, but which could create a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) if agreed to by the Government. The clause at 52.232-39 , Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations, automatically applies to any micro-purchase, including those made with the Governmentwide purchase card. This clause prevents such violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341).
13.203 Purchase guidelines.
(a) Solicitation, evaluation of quotations, and award.
(1) To the extent practicable, micro-purchases shall be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers.
(2) Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive quotations if the contracting officer or individual appointed in accordance with 1.603-3 (b) considers the price to be reasonable.
(3) The administrative cost of verifying the reasonableness of the price for purchases may more than offset potential savings from detecting instances of overpricing. Therefore, action to verify price reasonableness need only be taken if  
(i) The contracting officer or individual appointed in accordance with 1.603-3 (b) suspects or has information to indicate that the price may not be reasonable ( e.g., comparison to the previous price paid or personal knowledge of the supply or service); or
(ii) Purchasing a supply or service for which no comparable pricing information is readily available ( e.g., a supply or service that is not the same as, or is not similar to, other supplies or services that have recently been purchased on a competitive basis).
(b) Documentation. If competitive quotations were solicited and award was made to other than the low quoter, documentation to support the purchase may be limited to identification of the solicited concerns and an explanation for the award decision.
