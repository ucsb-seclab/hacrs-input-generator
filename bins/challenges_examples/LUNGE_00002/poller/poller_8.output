> Solicitation and Receipt of Proposals a
Subpart 15.2  Solicitation and Receipt of Proposals and Information
15.200 Scope of subpart.
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for  
(a) Exchanging information with industry prior to receipt of proposals;
(b) Preparing and issuing requests for proposals (RFPs) and requests for information (RFIs); and
(c) Receiving proposals and information.
15.201 Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals.
(a) Exchanges of information among all interested parties, from the earliest identification of a requirement through receipt of proposals, are encouraged. Any exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements (see 3.104 ). Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.
(b) The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government  s requirements, and enhancing the Government  s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.
(c) Agencies are encouraged to promote early exchanges of information about future acquisitions. An early exchange of information among industry and the program manager, contracting officer, and other participants in the acquisition process can identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type, terms and conditions, and acquisition planning schedules; the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requirements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information; the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions. Some techniques to promote early exchanges of information are  
(1) Industry or small business conferences;
(2) Public hearings;
(3) Market research, as described in Part 10 ;
(4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors (any that are substantially involved with potential contract terms and conditions should include the contracting officer; also see paragraph (f) of this section regarding restrictions on disclosure of information);
(5) Presolicitation notices;
(6) Draft RFPs;
(7) RFIs;
(8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences; and
(9) Site visits.
(d) The special notices of procurement matters at 5.205 (c), or electronic notices, may be used to publicize the Government  s requirement or solicit information from industry.
(e) RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. There is no required format for RFIs.
(f) General information about agency mission needs and future requirements may be disclosed at any time. After release of the solicitation, the contracting officer must be the focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offerors, that information must be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a potential offeror in response to its request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror  s confidential business strategy, and is protected under 3.104 or Subpart 24.2 . When conducting a presolicitation or preproposal conference, materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all potential offerors, upon request.
15.202 Advisory multi-step process.
(a) The agency may publish a presolicitation notice (see 5.204 ) that provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and invites potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The presolicitation notice should identify the information that must be submitted and the criteria that will be used in making the initial evaluation. Information sought may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information ( e.g., proposed technical concept, past performance, and limited pricing information). At a minimum, the notice shall contain sufficient information to permit a potential offeror to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. This process should not be used for multi-step acquisitions where it would result in offerors being required to submit identical information in response to the notice and in response to the initial step of the acquisition.
(b) The agency shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The agency shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.
15.203 Requests for proposals.
(a) Requests for proposals (RFPs) are used in negotiated acquisitions to communicate Government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals. RFPs for competitive acquisitions shall, at a minimum, describe the  
(1) Government  s requirement;
(2) Anticipated terms and conditions that will apply to the contract:
(i) The solicitation may authorize offerors to propose alternative terms and conditions, including the contract line item number (CLIN) structure; and
(ii) When alternative CLIN structures are permitted, the evaluation approach should consider the potential impact on other terms and conditions or the requirement ( e.g., place of performance or payment and funding requirements) (see 15.206 );
(3) Information required to be in the offeror  s proposal; and
(4) Factors and significant subfactors that will be used to evaluate the proposal and their relative importance.
(b) An RFP may be issued for OMB Circular A-76 studies. See Subpart 7.3 for additional information regarding cost comparisons between Government and contractor performance.
(c) Electronic commerce may be used to issue RFPs and to receive proposals, modifications, and revisions. In this case, the RFP shall specify the electronic commerce method(s) that offerors may use (see Subpart 4.5 ).
(d) Contracting officers may issue RFPs and/or authorize receipt of proposals, modifications, or revisions by facsimile.
(1) In deciding whether or not to use facsimiles, the contracting officer should consider factors such as  
(i) Anticipated proposal size and volume;
(ii) Urgency of the requirement;
(iii) Availability and suitability of electronic commerce methods; and
(iv) Adequacy of administrative procedures and controls for receiving, identifying, recording, and safeguarding facsimile proposals, and ensuring their timely delivery to the designated proposal delivery location.
(2) If facsimile proposals are authorized, contracting officers may request offeror(s) to provide the complete, original signed proposal at a later date.
(e) Letter RFPs may be used in sole source acquisitions and other appropriate circumstances. Use of a letter RFP does not relieve the contracting officer from complying with other FAR requirements. Letter RFPs should be as complete as possible and, at a minimum, should contain the following:
(1) RFP number and date;
(2) Name, address (including electronic address and facsimile address, if appropriate), and telephone number of the contracting officer;
(3) Type of contract contemplated;
(4) Quantity, description, and required delivery dates for the item;
(5) Applicable certifications and representations;
(6) Anticipated contract terms and conditions;
(7) Instructions to offerors and evaluation criteria for other than sole source actions;
(8) Proposal due date and time; and
(9) Other relevant information; e.g., incentives, variations in delivery schedule, cost proposal support, and data requirements.
(f) Oral RFPs are authorized when processing a written solicitation would delay the acquisition of supplies or services to the detriment of the Government and a notice is not required under 5.202 ( e.g., perishable items and support of contingency operations or other emergency situations). Use of an oral RFP does not relieve the contracting officer from complying with other FAR requirements.
(1) The contract files supporting oral solicitations should include  
(i) A description of the requirement;
(ii) Rationale for use of an oral solicitation;
(iii) Sources solicited, including the date, time, name of individuals contacted, and prices offered; and
(iv) The solicitation number provided to the prospective offerors.
(2) The information furnished to potential offerors under oral solicitations should include appropriate items from paragraph (e) of this section.
15.204 Contract format.
The use of a uniform contract format facilitates preparation of the solicitation and contract as well as reference to, and use of, those documents by offerors, contractors, and contract administrators. The uniform contract format need not be used for the following:
(a) Construction and architect-engineer contracts (see Part 36 ).
(b) Subsistence contracts.
(c) Supplies or services contracts requiring special contract formats prescribed elsewhere in this regulation that are inconsistent with the uniform format.
(d) Letter requests for proposals (see 15.203 (e)).
(e) Contracts exempted by the agency head or designee.
15.204-1 Uniform contract format.
(a) Contracting officers shall prepare solicitations and resulting contracts using the uniform contract format outlined in Table 15-1 of this subsection.
(b) Solicitations using the uniform contract format shall include Parts I, II, III, and IV (see 15.204-2 through 15.204-5 ). Upon award, contracting officers shall not physically include Part IV in the resulting contract, but shall retain it in the contract file. (See 4.1201 (c).) Section K shall be incorporated by reference in the contract.

(d) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(e) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

Subpart 15.2  Solicitation and Receipt of Proposals and Information
15.200 Scope of subpart.
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for  
(a) Exchanging information with industry prior to receipt of proposals;
(b) Preparing and issuing requests for proposals (RFPs) and requests for information (RFIs); and
(c) Receiving proposals and information.
15.201 Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals.
(a) Exchanges of information among all interested parties, from the earliest identification of a requirement through receipt of proposals, are encouraged. Any exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements (see 3.104 ). Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.
(b) The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government  s requirements, and enhancing the Government  s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.
(c) Agencies are encouraged to promote early exchanges of information about future acquisitions. An early exchange of information among industry and the program manager, contracting officer, and other participants in the acquisition process can identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type, terms and conditions, and acquisition planning schedules; the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requirements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information; the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions. Some techniques to promote early exchanges of information are  
(1) Industry or small business conferences;
(2) Public hearings;
(3) Market research, as described in Part 10 ;
(4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors (any that are substantially involved with potential contract terms and conditions should include the contracting officer; also see paragraph (f) of this section regarding restrictions on disclosure of information);
(5) Presolicitation notices;
(6) Draft RFPs;
(7) RFIs;
(8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences; and
(9) Site visits.
(d) The special notices of procurement matters at 5.205 (c), or electronic notices, may be used to publicize the Government  s requirement or solicit information from industry.
(e) RFIs may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. There is no required format for RFIs.
(f) General information about agency mission needs and future requirements may be disclosed at any time. After release of the solicitation, the contracting officer must be the focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offerors, that information must be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a potential offeror in response to its request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror  s confidential business strategy, and is protected under 3.104 or Subpart 24.2 . When conducting a presolicitation or preproposal conference, materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all potential offerors, upon request.
15.202 Advisory multi-step process.
(a) The agency may publish a presolicitation notice (see 5.204 ) that provides a general description of the scope or purpose of the acquisition and invites potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The presolicitation notice should identify the information that must be submitted and the criteria that will be used in making the initial evaluation. Information sought may be limited to a statement of qualifications and other appropriate information ( e.g., proposed technical concept, past performance, and limited pricing information). At a minimum, the notice shall contain sufficient information to permit a potential offeror to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition. This process should not be used for multi-step acquisitions where it would result in offerors being required to submit identical information in response to the notice and in response to the initial step of the acquisition.
(b) The agency shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in the notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The agency shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.
15.203 Requests for proposals.
(a) Requests for proposals (RFPs) are used in negotiated acquisitions to communicate Government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals. RFPs for competitive acquisitions shall, at a minimum, describe the  
(1) Government  s requirement;
(2) Anticipated terms and conditions that will apply to the contract:
(i) The solicitation may authorize offerors to propose alternative terms and conditions, including the contract line item number (CLIN) structure; and
(ii) When alternative CLIN structures are permitted, the evaluation approach should consider the potential impact on other terms and conditions or the requirement ( e.g., place of performance or payment and funding requirements) (see 15.206 );
(3) Information required to be in the offeror  s proposal; and
(4) Factors and significant subfactors that will be used to evaluate the proposal and their relative importance.
(b) An RFP may be issued for OMB Circular A-76 studies. See Subpart 7.3 for additional information regarding cost comparisons between Government and contractor performance.
(c) Electronic commerce may be used to issue RFPs and to receive proposals, modifications, and revisions. In this case, the RFP shall specify the electronic commerce method(s) that offerors may use (see Subpart 4.5 ).
(d) Contracting officers may issue RFPs and/or authorize receipt of proposals, modifications, or revisions by facsimile.
(1) In deciding whether or not to use facsimiles, the contracting officer should consider factors such as  
(i) Anticipated proposal size and volume;
(ii) Urgency of the requirement;
(iii) Availability and suitability of electronic commerce methods; and
(iv) Adequacy of administrative procedures and controls for receiving, identifying, recording, and safeguarding facsimile proposals, and ensuring their timely delivery to the designated proposal delivery location.
(2) If facsimile proposals are authorized, contracting officers may request offeror(s) to provide the complete, original signed proposal at a later date.
(e) Letter RFPs may be used in sole source acquisitions and other appropriate circumstances. Use of a letter RFP does not relieve the contracting officer from complying with other FAR requirements. Letter RFPs should be as complete as possible and, at a minimum, should contain the following:
(1) RFP number and date;
(2) Name, address (including electronic address and facsimile address, if appropriate), and telephone number of the contracting officer;
(3) Type of contract contemplated;
(4) Quantity, description, and required delivery dates for the item;
(5) Applicable certifications and representations;
(6) Anticipated contract terms and conditions;
(7) Instructions to offerors and evaluation criteria for other than sole source actions;
(8) Proposal due date and time; and
(9) Other relevant information; e.g., incentives, variations in delivery schedule, cost proposal support, and data requirements.
(f) Oral RFPs are authorized when processing a written solicitation would delay the acquisition of supplies or services to the detriment of the Government and a notice is not required under 5.202 ( e.g., perishable items and support of contingency operations or other emergency situations). Use of an oral RFP does not relieve the contracting officer from complying with other FAR requirements.
(1) The contract files supporting oral solicitations should include  
(i) A description of the requirement;
(ii) Rationale for use of an oral solicitation;
(iii) Sources solicited, including the date, time, name of individuals contacted, and prices offered; and
(iv) The solicitation number provided to the prospective offerors.
(2) The information furnished to potential offerors under oral solicitations should include appropriate items from paragraph (e) of this section.
15.204 Contract format.
The use of a uniform contract format facilitates preparation of the solicitation and contract as well as reference to, and use of, those documents by offerors, contractors, and contract administrators. The uniform contract format need not be used for the following:
(a) Construction and architect-engineer contracts (see Part 36 ).
(b) Subsistence contracts.
(c) Supplies or services contracts requiring special contract formats prescribed elsewhere in this regulation that are inconsistent with the uniform format.
(d) Letter requests for proposals (see 15.203 (e)).
(e) Contracts exempted by the agency head or designee.
15.204-1 Uniform contract format.
(a) Contracting officers shall prepare solicitations and resulting contracts using the uniform contract format outlined in Table 15-1 of this subsection.
(b) Solicitations using the uniform contract format shall include Parts I, II, III, and IV (see 15.204-2 through 15.204-5 ). Upon award, contracting officers shall not physically include Part IV in the resulting contract, but shall retain it in the contract file. (See 4.1201 (c).) Section K shall be incorporated by reference in the contract.

Subpart 8.7  Acquisition from Nonprofit Agencies Employing People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
8.700 Scope of subpart.
This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures for implementing the Javits-Wagner-O  Day Act ( 41 U.S.C. 46-48c ) and the rules of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (41 CFR Chapter 51) which implements the AbilityOne Program.
8.701 Definitions.
As used in this subpart  
Allocation  means an action taken by a central nonprofit agency to designate the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies that will furnish definite quantities of supplies or perform specific services upon receipt of orders from ordering offices.
Central nonprofit agency  means National Industries for the Blind (NIB), which has been designated to represent people who are blind; or NISH, which has been designated to represent AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies serving people with severe disabilities other than blindness.
Committee  means the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
Government  or  entity of the Government  means any entity of the legislative or judicial branch, any executive agency, military department, Government corporation, or independent establishment, the U.S. Postal Service, or any nonappropriated-fund instrumentality of the Armed Forces.
Ordering office  means any activity in an entity of the Government that places orders for the purchase of supplies or services under the AbilityOne Program.
Procurement List  means a list of supplies (including military resale commodities) and services that the Committee has determined are suitable for purchase by the Government under the Javits-Wagner-O  Day Act.
Nonprofit agency serving people who are blind  or  nonprofit agency serving people with other severe disabilities  (referred to jointly as AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies) means a qualified nonprofit agency employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities approved by the Committee to furnish a commodity or a service to the Government under the Act.
8.702 General.
The Committee is an independent Government activity with members appointed by the President of the United States. It is responsible for  
(a) Determining those supplies and services to be purchased by all entities of the Government from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies;
(b) Establishing prices for the supplies and services; and
(c) Establishing rules and regulations to implement the Javits-Wagner-O  Day Act.
8.703 Procurement List.
The Committee maintains a Procurement List of all supplies and services required to be purchased from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies. The Procurement List may be accessed at: http://www.abilityone.gov . Questions concerning whether a supply item or service is on the Procurement List may be submitted at Internet e-mail address info@abilityone.gov or referred to the Committee offices at the following address and telephone number: 
Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, 1401 S. Clark Street, Suite 10800, Arlington, VA 22202-3259, (703) 603-7740.
Many items on the Procurement List are identified in the General Services Administration (GSA) Supply Catalog and GSA  s Customer Service Center Catalogs with a black square and the words  NIB/NISH Mandatory Source,  and in similar catalogs issued by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). GSA, DLA, and VA are central supply agencies from which other Federal agencies are required to purchase certain supply items on the Procurement List.
8.704 Purchase priorities.
(a) The Javits-Wagner-O  Day Act requires the Government to purchase supplies or services on the Procurement List, at prices established by the Committee, from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies if they are available within the period required. When identical supplies or services are on the Procurement List and the Schedule of Products issued by Federal Prison Industries, Inc., ordering offices shall purchase supplies and services in the following priorities:
(1) Supplies:
(i) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. ( 41 U.S.C. 48 ).
(ii) AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies.
(iii) Commercial sources.
(2) Services:
(i) AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies.
(ii) Federal Prison Industries, Inc., or commercial sources.
(b) No other provision of the FAR shall be construed as permitting an exception to the mandatory purchase of items on the Procurement List.
(c) The Procurement List identifies those supplies for which the ordering office must obtain a formal waiver ( 8.604 ) from Federal Prison Industries, Inc., before making any purchases from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies.
8.705 Procedures.
8.705-1 General.
(a) Ordering offices shall obtain supplies and services on the Procurement List from the central nonprofit agency or its designated AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies, except that supplies identified on the Procurement List as available from DLA, GSA, or VA supply distribution facilities shall be obtained through DLA, GSA, or VA procedures. If a distribution facility cannot provide the supplies, it shall inform the ordering office, which shall then order from the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency designated by the Committee.
(b) Supply distribution facilities in DLA and GSA shall obtain supplies on the Procurement List from the central nonprofit agency identified or its designated AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency.
8.705-2 Direct-order process.
Central nonprofit agencies may authorize ordering offices to transmit orders for specific supplies or services directly to an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency. The written authorization remains valid until it is revoked by the central nonprofit agency or the Committee. The central nonprofit agency shall specify the normal delivery or performance lead time required by the nonprofit agency. The ordering office shall reflect this lead time in its orders.
8.705-3 Allocation process.
(a) When the direct order process has not been authorized, the ordering office shall submit a letter request for allocation (requesting the designation of the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency to produce the supplies or perform the service) to the central nonprofit agency designated in the Procurement List. Ordering offices shall request allocations in sufficient time for a reply, for orders to be placed, and for the nonprofit agency to produce the supplies or provide the service within the required delivery or performance schedule.
(b) The ordering office  s request to the central nonprofit agency for allocation shall include the following information:
(1) For supplies  Item name, stock number, latest specification, quantity, unit price, date delivery is required, and destination to which delivery is to be made.
(2) For services  Type and location of service required, latest specification, work to be performed, estimated volume, and required date or dates for completion.
(3) Other requirements; e.g., packing, marking, as necessary.
(c) When an allocation is received, the ordering office shall promptly issue an order to the specified AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency or to the central nonprofit agency, as instructed by the allocation. If the issuance of an order is to be delayed for more than 15 days beyond receipt of the allocation, or canceled, the ordering office shall advise the central nonprofit agency immediately.
(d) Ordering offices may issue orders without limitation as to dollar amount and shall record them upon issuance as obligations. Each order shall include, as a minimum, the information contained in the request for allocation. Ordering offices shall also include additional instructions necessary for performance under the order; e.g., on the handling of Government-furnished property, reports required, and notification of shipment.
8.705-4 Compliance with orders.
(a) The central nonprofit agency shall inform the ordering office of changes in lead time experienced by its AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies to minimize requests for extension once the ordering office places an order.
(b) The ordering office shall grant a request by a central nonprofit agency or AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency for revision in the delivery or completion schedule, if feasible. If extension of the delivery or completion date is not feasible, the ordering office shall notify the appropriate central nonprofit agency and request that it reallocate the order, or grant a purchase exception authorizing acquisition from commercial sources.
(c) When an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency fails to perform under the terms of an order, the ordering office shall make every effort to resolve the noncompliance with the nonprofit agency involved and to negotiate an adjustment before taking action to cancel the order. If the problem cannot be resolved with the nonprofit agency, the ordering office shall refer the matter for resolution first to the central nonprofit agency and then, if necessary, to the Committee.
(d) When, after complying with 8.705-4 (c), the ordering office determines that it must cancel an order, it shall notify the central nonprofit agency and, if practical, request a reallocation of the order. When the central nonprofit agency cannot reallocate the order, it shall grant a purchase exception permitting use of commercial sources, subject to approval by the Committee when the value of the purchase exception is $25,000 or more.
8.706 Purchase exceptions.
(a) Ordering offices may acquire supplies or services on the Procurement List from commercial sources only if the acquisition is specifically authorized in a purchase exception granted by the designated central nonprofit agency.
(b) The central nonprofit agency shall promptly grant purchase exceptions when  
(1) The AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies cannot provide the supplies or services within the time required, and commercial sources can provide them significantly sooner in the quantities required; or
(2) The quantity required cannot be produced or provided economically by the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies.
(c) The central nonprofit agency granting the exception shall specify the quantity and delivery or performance period covered by the exception.
(d) When a purchase exception is granted, the contracting officer shall  
(1) Initiate purchase action within 15 days following the date of the exception or any extension granted by the central nonprofit agency; and
(2) Provide a copy of the solicitation to the central nonprofit agency when it is issued.
(e) The Committee may also grant a purchase exception, under any circumstances it considers appropriate.
8.707 Prices.
(a) The prices of items on the Procurement List are fair market prices established by the Committee. All prices for supplies ordered under this subpart are f.o.b. origin.
(b) Prices for supplies are normally adjusted semiannually. Prices for services are normally adjusted annually.
(c) The Committee may request the agency responsible for acquiring the supplies or service to assist it in establishing or revising the fair market price. The Committee has the authority to establish prices without prior coordination with the responsible contracting office.
(d) Price changes shall normally apply to all orders received by the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency on or after the effective date of the change. In special cases, after considering the views of the ordering office, the Committee may make price changes applicable to orders received by the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency prior to the effective date of the change.
(e) If an ordering office desires packing, packaging, or marking of supplies other than the standard pack as provided on the Procurement List, any difference in costs shall be included as a separate item on the nonprofit agency  s invoice. The ordering office shall reimburse the nonprofit agency for these costs.
(f) Ordering offices may make recommendations to the Committee at any time for price revisions for supplies and services on the Procurement List.
8.708 Shipping.
(a) Delivery is accomplished when a shipment is placed aboard the vehicle of the initial carrier. The time of delivery is the date shipment is released to and accepted by the initial carrier.
(b) Shipment is normally under Government bills of lading. However, for small orders, ordering offices may specify other shipment methods.
(c) When shipments are under Government bills of lading, the bills of lading may accompany orders or be otherwise furnished promptly. Failure of an ordering office to furnish bills of lading or to designate a method of transportation may result in an excusable delay in delivery.
(d) AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies shall include transportation costs for small shipments paid by the nonprofit agencies as an item on the invoice. The ordering office shall reimburse the nonprofit agencies for these costs.
8.709 Payments.
The ordering office shall make payments for supplies or services on the Procurement List within 30 days after shipment or after receipt of a proper invoice or voucher.
8.710 Quality of merchandise.
Supplies and services provided by AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies shall comply with the applicable Government specifications and standards cited in the order. When no specifications or standards exist  
(a) Supplies shall be of the highest quality and equal to similar items available on the commercial market; and
(b) Services shall conform to good commercial practices.
8.711 Quality complaints.
(a) When the quality of supplies or services received is unsatisfactory, the using activity shall take the following actions:
(1) For supplies received from DLA supply centers, GSA supply distribution facilities, or Department of Veterans Affairs distribution division, notify the supplying agency.
(2) For supplies or services received from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies, address complaints to the individual nonprofit agency involved, with a copy to the appropriate central nonprofit agency.
(b) When quality problems cannot be resolved by the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency and the ordering office, the ordering office shall first contact the central nonprofit agency and then, if necessary, the Committee for resolution.
8.712 Specification changes.
(a) The contracting activity shall notify the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency and appropriate central nonprofit agency of any change in specifications or descriptions. In the absence of such written notification, the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency shall furnish the supplies or services under the specification or description cited in the order.
(b) The contracting activity shall provide 90-days advance notification to the Committee and the central nonprofit agency on actions that affect supplies on the Procurement List and shall permit them to comment before action is taken, particularly when it involves  
(1) Changes that require new national stock numbers or item designations;
(2) Deleting items from the supply system;
(3) Standardization; or
(4) Developing new items to replace items on the Procurement List.
(c) For services, the contracting activity shall notify the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency and central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to the date that any changes in the scope of work or other conditions will be required.
(d) When, in order to meet its emergency needs, a contracting activity is unable to give the 90-day notification required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the contracting activity shall, at the time it places the order or change notice, inform the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency and the central nonprofit agency in writing of the reasons that it cannot meet the 90-day notification requirement.
8.713 Optional acquisition of supplies and services.
(a) Ordering offices may acquire supplies and services not included on the Procurement List from an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency that is the low responsive, responsible offeror under a solicitation issued by other authorized acquisition methods.
(b) Ordering offices should forward solicitations to AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies that may be qualified to provide the supplies or services required.

8.715 Replacement commodities.
When a commodity on the Procurement List is replaced by another commodity which has not been previously acquired, and a qualified AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency can furnish the replacement commodity in accordance with the Government  s quality standards and delivery schedules and at a fair market price, the replacement commodity is automatically on the Procurement List and shall be acquired from the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency designated by the Committee. The commodity being replaced shall continue to be included on the Procurement List until there is no longer a requirement for that commodity.

Subpart 18.2  Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities
18.201 Contingency operation.
(a) Contingency operation is defined in 2.101 .
(b) Micro-purchase threshold . The threshold increases when the head of the agency determines the supplies or services are to be used to support a contingency operation. (See 2.101 and 13.201 (g).)
(c) Simplified acquisition threshold . The threshold increases when the head of the agency determines the supplies or services are to be used to support a contingency operation. (See 2.101 .)
(d) SF 44 , Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher . The normal threshold for the use of the SF 44 is at or below the micro-purchase threshold. Agencies may, however, establish higher dollar limitations for purchases made to support a contingency operation. (See 13.306 .)
(e) Test program for certain commercial items . The threshold limits authorized for use of the test program may be increased for acquisitions to support a contingency operation. (See 13.500 (e).)
18.202 Defense or recovery from certain attacks.
(a) Micro-purchase threshold . The threshold increases when the head of the agency determines the supplies or services are to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. (See 2.101 .)
(b) Simplified acquisition threshold . The threshold increases when the head of the agency determines the supplies or services are to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. (See 2.101 .)
(c) Commercial items to facilitate defense and recovery . Contracting officers may treat any acquisition of supplies or services as an acquisition of commercial items if the head of the agency determines the acquisition is to be used to facilitate the defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. (See 12.102 (f)(1) and 13.500 (e).)
(d) Test program for certain commercial items . The threshold limits authorized for use of the test program may be increased when it is determined the acquisition is to facilitate defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. (See 13.500 (e).)
18.203 Emergency declaration or major disaster declaration.
(a) Disaster or emergency assistance activities . Preference will be given to local organizations, firms, and individuals when contracting for major disaster or emergency assistance activities when the President has made a declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Preference may take the form of local area set-asides or an evaluation preference. (See 6.208 and Subpart 26.2 .)
(b) Ocean transportation by U.S. flag vessels . The provisions of the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 may be waived in emergency situations. (See 47.502 (c).)
18.204 Resources.
(a) National Response Framework . The National Response Framework (NRF) is a guide to how the Nation conducts all-hazards response. This key document establishes a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to domestic incident response. The Framework identifies the key response principles, roles and structures that organize national response. It describes how communities, States, the Federal Government, the private-sector, and nongovernmental partners apply these principles for a coordinated, effective national response. It also describes special circumstances where the Federal Government exercises a larger role, including incidents where Federal interests are involved and catastrophic incidents where a State would require significant support. The NRF is available at http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nrf/ .
(b) OFPP Guidelines . The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP)  Emergency Acquisitions Guide  is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/procurement_guides/emergency_acquisitions_guide.pd f
